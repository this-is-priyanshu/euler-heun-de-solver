# Differential Equation Solver
This project is a web-based tool for solving differential equations of 1st order using Euler's method and Heun's method.
### Features
- User can choose between Euler's and Heun's method
- Solves differential equations of the type **dy/dx = f(x, y)**
- Generates a table of computed values
- Visualization of solution through a comparative plot of the two methods on a graph
### Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS**: For the web interface
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the numerical methods
- **Plotly.js**: For graph plotting
